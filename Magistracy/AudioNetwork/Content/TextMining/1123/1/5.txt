proves under these update rules, and converges to an optimal solution.One interesting observation about the matrix factorization techniqueis that it can also be used to determine word-clusters instead of documentclusters. Just as the columns of V provide a basis which canbe used to discover document clusters, we can use the columns of Uto discover a basis which correspond to word clusters. As we will seelater, document clusters and word clusters are closely related, and it isoften useful to discover both simultaneously, as in frameworks such asco-clustering [30, 31, 75]. Matrix-factorization provides a natural way ofachieving this goal. It has also been shown both theoretically and experimentally[33, 93] that the matrix-factorization technique is equivalentto another graph-structure based document clustering technique known
