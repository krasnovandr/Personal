Text clustering algorithms are divided into a wide variety of differenttypes such as agglomerative clustering algorithms, partitioning algorithms,and standard parametric modeling based methods such as theEM-algorithm. Furthermore, text representations may also be treatedas strings (rather than bags of words). These different representationsnecessitate the design of different classes of clustering algorithms. Differentclustering algorithms have different tradeoffs in terms of effectivenessand efficiency. An experimental comparison of different clustering algorithmsmay be found in [90, 111]. In this chapter we will discuss a widevariety of algorithms which are commonly used for text clustering. Wewill also discuss text clustering algorithms for related scenarios such asdynamic data, network-based text data and semi-supervised scenarios
