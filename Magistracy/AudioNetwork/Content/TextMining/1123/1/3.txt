This chapter is organized as follows. In section 2, we will present featureselection and transformation methods for text clustering. Section 3describes a number of common algorithms which are used for distancebasedclustering of text documents. Section 4 contains the descriptionof methods for clustering with the use of word patterns and phrases.Methods for clustering text streams are described in section 5. Section6 describes methods for probabilistic clustering of text data. Section7 contains a description of methods for clustering text which naturallyoccurs in the context of social or web-based networks. Section 8 discussesmethods for semi-supervised clustering. Section 9 presents theconclusions and summary.
