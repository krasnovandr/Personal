Roberto Firmino played a more orthodox centre-forward role today. Everything he did was excellent. He held the ball up well, he ran in behind, he linked up play and found himself in goalscoring positions as well.Watford could not cope with him and he got the goal that his performance deserved. Liverpool were breathtaking in attack. The front three normally have freedom to go anywhere. It was a bit different today, but it was a nightmare for Watford.Thirty goals in 11 games shows you how good they are going forward, but it will have hurt not keeping a clean sheet. They have only got one this season. There will be days when the forwards can't score and they will need to depend on the defence.
