Liverpool have hit the Premier League summit and there can be no doubt whatsoever that Jurgen Klopp's team are title contenders.The fact there were five different goalscorers in Sunday's win sums up the strength and potency of a Liverpool side that has hit a red-hot streak since that surprise 2-0 loss at Burnley in their second league game of the season.Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana have the pace, movement and threat to pose a danger to any side, while captain Jordan Henderson has been a revelation this season.Yes, questions remain about the quality of their defence and new goalkeeper Loris Karius, but this Liverpool team carries a level of menace that has echoes of the Luis Suarez-inspired side that almost won the title in 2013-14.
