This calls the function pam or clara to perform a partitioning around medoids clustering with the number of clusters estimated by optimum average silhouette width (see pam.object) or Calinski-Harabasz index (calinhara). The Duda-Hart test (dudahart2) is applied to decide whether there should be more than one cluster (unless 1 is excluded as number of clusters or data are dissimilarities).
