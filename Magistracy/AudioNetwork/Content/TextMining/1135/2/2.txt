Analyzing open-ended survey responses. In survey research (e.g., marketing), it is not uncommon to include various open-ended questions pertaining to the topic under investigation. The idea is to permit respondents to express their &#34;views&#34; or opinions without constraining them to particular dimensions or a particular response format. This may yield insights into customers' views and opinions that might otherwise not be discovered when relying solely on structured questionnaires designed by &#34;experts.&#34; For example, you may discover a certain set of words or terms that are commonly used by respondents to describe the pro's and con's of a product or service (under investigation), suggesting common misconceptions or confusion regarding the items in the study.
