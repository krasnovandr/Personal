Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[23] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[34] Newsted's bass on the album was purposely attenuated as part of the continuous &#34;hazing&#34; he received, and his musical ideas were ignoredâ€”though he received writing credit for the track &#34;Blackened&#34;.[35] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars &#34;buzz thinly&#34;.[36] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[37]
