Metallica was due to make its first appearance in India at the &#34;India Rocks&#34; concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.[112] However, the concert was canceled when the venue was proven to be unsafe.[113] Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud.[114] Metallica made its Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011.[115][116] On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would headline the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, at the Download Festival at Donington Park and that the band would play the The Black Album in its entirety.[117] Metallica celebrated its 30th anniversary by playing four shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco in December 2011. The shows were exclusive to Met Club members and tickets were charged at $6 each or $19.81 for all four nights. The shows consisted of songs from the band's career and featured guest appearances by artists who had either helped or had influenced Metallica. These shows were notable because Lloyd Grant, Dave Mustaine, Jason Newsted, Glenn Danzig, Ozzy Osbourne, Jerry Cantrell, Apocalyptica, members of Diamond Head, and King Diamond joined Metallica on stage for all appropriate songs.[118][119] In December 2011, Metallica began releasing songs that were written for Death Magnetic but were not included on the album online.[120] On December 13, 2011, the band released Beyond Magnetic, a digital EP release exclusively on iTunes.[121] It was released on CD in January 2012.[122]
