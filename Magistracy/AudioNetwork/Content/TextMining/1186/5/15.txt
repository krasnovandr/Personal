In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989â€“2004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[70] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's &#34;The Ecstasy of Gold&#34; for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category &#34;Best Rock Instrumental Performance&#34;.[71] A recording of &#34;The Ecstasy of Gold&#34; has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[72] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[73] Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, &#34;The Day That Never Comes&#34;.Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield performing with the band in London in 2008On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[74] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, &#34;...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me&#34;,[75] and, &#34;By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that.&#34;[76]
