In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's &#34;steely&#34; sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[62] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, &#34;the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing&#34;.[63] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as &#34;an utter mess&#34;.[64] However, Blender magazine called it the &#34;grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions&#34;, and New York Magazine called it &#34;utterly raw and rocking&#34;.[65] The title track, &#34;St. Anger&#34;, won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[66]Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[67] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed &#34;Battery&#34; and &#34;The Four Horsemen&#34;, Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed &#34;Fade to Black&#34;, and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[68] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[69
