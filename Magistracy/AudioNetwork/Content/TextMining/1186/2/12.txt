At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's &#34;I Disappear&#34;. Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just &#34;sharing&#34; by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was &#34;borrowing things that were not yours without asking&#34;. He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, &#34;I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own.&#34; Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[57][58]Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. His said he left the band for &#34;private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love&#34;.[59] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, &#34;When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica&#34;, and that a side project is &#34;like cheating on your wife in a way&#34;.[35] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, &#34;My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them&#34;, and pondered questions such as, &#34;Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?&#34;[35]
