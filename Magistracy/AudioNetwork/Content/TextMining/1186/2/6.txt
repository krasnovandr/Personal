In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[38]The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song &#34;One&#34;. Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[38] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's &#34;Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets&#34;.[39]Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song &#34;One&#34;, which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999 it was voted number 38 in 1999 in MTV's &#34;Top 100 Videos of All Time&#34; countdown;[40] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[41]
