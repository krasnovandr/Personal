In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[13] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[14] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammettreplaced Mustaine the same afternoonMustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett &#34;stole&#34; his job.[15]Mustaine was &#34;pissed off&#34; because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[16] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, &#34;it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.Â 1 guitarist in your magazine&#34;.[17] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song &#34;Mechanix&#34;, which Metallica reworked and retitled &#34;The Four Horsemen&#34; on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to &#34;straighten Metallica up&#34; because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[11] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[18] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.
