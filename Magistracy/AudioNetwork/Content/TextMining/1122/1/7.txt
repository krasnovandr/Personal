British Prime Minister David Cameron is to resign on Wednesday, paving the way for Home Secretary Theresa May to take the reins.                        May was officially named Conservative party leader and successor to Cameron 'with immediate effect' Monday, said Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, which is a collection of conservative members of parliament that is key to electing the party leader. She will replace Cameron on Wednesday evening.                        Cameron had already announced in June that he would step down by October, after failing to convince the country to remain in the European Union in a divisive referendum that has sent shockwaves through Britain's political establishment.                        But on Monday, May's only remaining rival to replace Cameron -- Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom -- pulled out of the race following controversy over comments she made about motherhood and leadership.                        'Obviously, with these changes, we now don't need to have a prolonged period of transition. And so tomorrow I will chair my last cabinet meeting. On Wednesday I will attend the House of Commons for prime minister's questions. And then after that I expect to go to the palace and offer my resignation. So we will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,' Cameron told reporters outside 10 Downing Street on Monday.&#34;,
